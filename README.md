# Enhancing Construction Site Safety: Advanced Deep Learning Approaches for Accurate Helmet Detection
Eleanna Panagiotou, Zack Sifakis 

This is a project created for course ECE766 (Spring24)


## Environment Preparation

### Start by cloning this repo
```bash
https://github.com/EleannaPanagiotou/ECE766-HelmetDetection.git
```

## Conda
To set up the necessary environment for this project, install the Conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:
```bash
conda activate helmet-detection-env
```

## Model Evaluation

### YOLOv5n
To run a few demos with YOLOv5n approach, open the `Helmet_yolov5.ipynb` file and run all the cells sequentially.

### YOLOv8n
To run a few demos with YOLOv8n approach, open the `Helmet_yolov8.ipynb` file and run all the cells sequentially.

### DEtection TRansformer
To run a few demos with DETR approach, open the `Helmet_detr.ipynb` file and run all the cells sequentially.

## Model Training 
TBA
